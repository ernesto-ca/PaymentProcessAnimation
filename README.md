# E-commerce App UI

This is an only ui application where the experience is the most important, in this project I'll turn a boring UI navigation and images to full animation experience.

**This project only works for practicing animations and UX, it will never works as a real payment process.**

## The UI

A good UI design and full color pallet can make a big difference for the user, with Flutter you can create awesome and beautiful apps and it is simple.

Colors, images and the nice design are from _Ashish Chutake_ in Uplabs site, here is the [link](https://www.uplabs.com/posts/payment-flow-for-e-commerce).

The next gif shows how navigation and feeling is BEFORE applying Animation:

Don't forget to see all packages I used in **pubspec.yaml**.
